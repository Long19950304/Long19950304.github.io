I build **AI-native media production pipelines** where engineering and evaluation are first-class outputs.

Representative directions:
- Multi-model orchestration for end-to-end content generation (prompting + tools + agents)
- Evaluation-first workflows (quality gates, benchmarks, error analysis)
- Reproducibility and governance (logs, versioning, auditability)
