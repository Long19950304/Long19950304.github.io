My 3–5 year agenda is **Agentic Engineering (AE+X)**: the goal is not only to use AI/LLMs, but to **design, evaluate, and deploy** multi-agent architectures that deliver reliable outcomes in real workflows.

Key themes:
- Evaluation and benchmarking for agentic systems (reliability, calibration, failure analysis)
- Reproducible pipelines for human/LLM hybrid coding and quality assurance
- Governance as a first-class output (documentation, auditability, responsible AI)
