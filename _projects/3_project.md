I develop **computational communication / computational social science** projects that combine large-scale data, careful measurement, and defensible designs.

Representative directions:
- Platform and agenda dynamics (large-scale text + time-series signals)
- Measurement and validation for AI-assisted research pipelines
- Causal designs and policy evaluation with observational data (transparent assumptions + robustness checks)
