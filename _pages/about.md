I am **Zhilong Zhao (赵志龙)**, a communication and digital media researcher with an increasing focus on **AI-native workflows**, **LLM evaluation**, and an emerging 3–5 year agenda I summarize as **Agentic Engineering (AGE + X)**: designing, testing, and deploying multi-agent systems that deliver reliable outcomes for research and production tasks.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher and Assistant Researcher** at the School of Journalism and Communication, South China University of Technology (SCUT).

My current interests include:
- **AGE for social science**: reliability and benchmarking for LLM-assisted qualitative analysis (complex coding, calibration, error analysis)
- **AGE for media workflows**: AI-native, code-first pipelines for scripting, visuals, subtitles, packaging, and publishing, with evaluation and governance as first-class outputs
- **AGE for applied learning**: studio-style teaching that links prototype building to evaluation, documentation, and responsible AI practice
