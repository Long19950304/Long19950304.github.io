I am **Zhilong George Zhao (赵志龙)**, a communication and digital media researcher working at the intersection of **AI-native workflows**, **LLM evaluation**, and **multi-agent systems**. My next 3–5 year agenda is **Agentic Engineering (AE + X)**: designing, testing, and deploying multi-agent architectures that deliver reliable outcomes in real research and production workflows.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher and Assistant Researcher** at the School of Journalism and Communication, South China University of Technology (SCUT), and I am preparing faculty applications in Communication & Digital Media.

## Focus (AE + X)

- **AE for social science**: reliability and benchmarking for LLM-assisted qualitative analysis (complex coding, calibration, error analysis).
- **AE for media workflows**: code-first multi-model/agentic pipelines for scripting → visuals → subtitles → packaging → publishing, with evaluation and governance as first-class outputs.
- **AE for applied learning**: studio-style teaching that links prototype building to evaluation, documentation, and responsible AI practice.

## What I build

- Multi-agent workflows for annotation, evaluation, and quality assurance (human/LLM hybrid).
- AI-native media pipelines that minimize “legacy tool” dependence and maximize reproducibility.
- Teaching formats that combine **within-team collaboration** with **between-team competition** (project outcome–oriented).
