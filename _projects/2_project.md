I build **AI-native, code-first** media workflows that integrate multiple models and agents to support:

- Scripting and iteration
- Visual generation and packaging
- Subtitles and localization
- Publishing and performance monitoring

The focus is on **speed with quality**: evaluation, verification, and logging are built into the pipeline rather than added later.
