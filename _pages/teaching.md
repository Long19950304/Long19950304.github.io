I design applied-learning courses that are **AI-forward**, **product/outcome oriented**, and emphasize **teamwork with structured competition** (strong collaboration within teams; transparent competition between teams).

Teaching directions:
- Social Media Marketing (strategy + measurement; AI-assisted workflows)
- Digital Content Creation / Production (AI-native pipelines + evaluation)
- Computational Communication / Digital Methods (annotation, benchmarking, reproducible workflows)
- AI-Assisted Research Methods (LLM evaluation, reliability, calibration, responsible use)
- Multi-Agent Engineering Studio (team-based product building + evaluation)
