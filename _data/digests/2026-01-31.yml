  title: 175K+ publicly-exposed Ollama AI instances discovered
  why: A large number of self-hosted Ollama endpoints are reportedly exposed to the
    public internet, raising the risk of data leakage and abuse.
  takeaway: 'If you run local LLM tooling, treat it like any other service: bind to
    localhost by default, put it behind auth/reverse proxy when remote access is needed,
    and monitor logs for unexpected traffic.'
  prompt: Do you have any local AI endpoints that might be reachable from the public
    internet?

  title_zh: 发现17.5万+公开暴露的Ollama AI实例
  why_zh: 据报道，大量自托管的Ollama端点暴露在公共互联网上，增加了数据泄露和滥用的风险。
  takeaway_zh: 如果您运行本地LLM工具，请像对待其他服务一样：默认绑定到本地主机，远程访问时置于认证/反向代理之后，并监控日志以发现异常流量。

  title: The $100B Megadeal Between OpenAI and Nvidia Is on Ice
  why: Mega-scale AI infrastructure plans can move markets—but they also face financing,
    demand, and execution risk.
  takeaway: A reported pause on an OpenAI–Nvidia mega-deal is a reminder that even
    top AI players are still constrained by capital, supply chains, and uncertainty
    about long-run compute demand.
  prompt: What signal would convince you that today’s AI infra spend will still pay
    off in 2–3 years?

  title: Russian hackers breached Polish power grid thanks to bad security, report
    says
  why: Critical infrastructure incidents still often trace back to basic security
    gaps—segmentation, access control, and monitoring.
  takeaway: 'The headline is geopolitics, but the lesson is operational: attackers
    exploit weak links and misconfigurations; resilience comes from boring, repeatable
    controls.'
  prompt: If you had to harden one ‘boring’ control today (patching, MFA, segmentation,
    backups), which would it be?

  why: A detailed look at the economics and supply chain behind non-consensual deepfakes—where

  title: Practical Security Guidance for Sandboxing Agentic Workflows and Managing
    Execution Risk
  why: Agentic workflows that browse the web and execute code expand the attack surface;
    this offers a concrete checklist for sandboxing and execution controls.
  takeaway: 'Assume tools and tool outputs are untrusted: isolate execution, restrict
    egress, minimize permissions, log actions, and add human review for sensitive
    operations.'
  prompt: Which tasks in your workflow should never be delegated to an agent without
    a sandbox?

  title: Anthropic brings agentic plug-ins to Cowork
  why: Plugins push AI assistants from chat into real workflows—useful, but they raise
    the stakes on permissions and data handling.
  takeaway: 'The value shifts to integrations: assistants become more powerful as
    they can act across tools, but governance is needed to prevent overreach and leakage.'
  prompt: Which integration would make an AI assistant genuinely useful for your work—email,
    docs, code, or data?

    gains for AI workloads—and lower the cost of writing fast GPU code.
  takeaway: Better Triton/CUDA backends can shrink the gap between research prototypes
    and production-grade kernels, accelerating iteration for teams that optimize inference/training.
  prompt: Where do you hit the most friction with GPU performance work—debugging,
    portability, or tuning?

  why: Transparency reports are becoming a baseline trust signal as platforms scale
    and face more moderation and legal pressure.

    response times, and appeal processes) determine whether it builds trust.
