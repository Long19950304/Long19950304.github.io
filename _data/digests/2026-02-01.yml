  title: 'Generative AI and Wikipedia editing: What we learned in 2025'
  why: A year-end reflection on how generative AI is changing Wikipedia editing—workflows,
    quality control, and community norms.
  takeaway: 'The durable lesson is governance-by-design: make provenance/citations
    easy, keep humans in the loop, and align incentives so AI speeds up drafting without
    eroding verification.'
  prompt: What’s the most practical ‘human-in-the-loop’ checkpoint for AI-assisted
    knowledge production?

  title: Autonomous cars, drones cheerfully obey prompt injection by road sign
  why: 'Physical prompt injection: road signs and other real-world text can steer
    autonomous cars/drones if systems treat external instructions as trusted.'
  takeaway: Robust autonomy needs strict separation between perception and instruction,
    plus sandboxed actions and safe defaults when inputs look adversarial.
  prompt: Where should autonomous systems draw the line between ‘readable text’ and
    ‘actionable instruction’?

  title: US has investigated claims WhatsApp chats aren't private
  why: US authorities reportedly investigated claims that WhatsApp chats aren’t private—another
    reminder that privacy depends on more than just ‘end-to-end encryption.’
  takeaway: Even with E2EE, metadata, device compromise, backups, and legal access
    paths can still undermine user privacy. Research and policy need to distinguish
    these layers clearly.
  prompt: 'When people say an app is ‘private’, which layer do they actually mean:
    content, metadata, device, or backups?'

  title: Mobile carriers can get your GPS location
  why: A technical walkthrough of how mobile carriers can infer GPS/GNSS location—highlighting
    a privacy surface that’s easy to underestimate.
  takeaway: For sensitive contexts, treat carrier-level location as potentially observable.
    Threat models for journalists, activists, and researchers should include carrier-side
    inference.
  prompt: What would a ‘reasonable’ transparency/consent regime for carrier-side location
    inference look like?

  title: Finland to end "uncontrolled human experiment" with ban on youth social media
  why: Finland is considering a ban on youth social media, framing current exposure
    as an uncontrolled ‘human experiment.’
  takeaway: We may see a shift from ‘parental controls’ to stricter age-gating and
    platform obligations—creating new demand for measurement, compliance, and impact
    evaluation.
  prompt: If a youth social-media ban were enacted, what outcome metrics would count
    as ‘success’ one year later?

  title: ChatGPT isn’t the only chatbot pulling answers from Elon Musk’s Grokipedia
  why: More chatbots are citing Elon Musk’s AI-generated ‘Grokipedia’, raising the
    risk of citation laundering and feedback loops in information ecosystems.
  takeaway: 'As AI-generated sources propagate into AI search/chat, provenance becomes
    a first-class requirement: we need stronger source vetting and clearer uncertainty
    signals.'
  prompt: Should AI systems be allowed to cite AI-generated encyclopedias by default—or
    require an explicit user opt-in?
