  <div style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
    <p>
      I am <strong>Zhilong George Zhao (赵志龙)</strong>, a communication and digital media researcher working at the intersection of <strong>AI-native workflows</strong>, <strong>LLM evaluation</strong>, and <strong>multi-agent systems</strong>. My next 3–5 year agenda is <strong>Agentic Engineering (AE+X)</strong>: designing, testing, and deploying multi-agent architectures that deliver reliable outcomes in real research and production workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher and Assistant Researcher</strong> at the School of Journalism and Communication, South China University of Technology (SCUT), and I am preparing faculty applications in Communication & Digital Media.

## Focus (AE+X)

- **AE for social science**: reliability and benchmarking for LLM-assisted qualitative analysis (complex coding, calibration, error analysis).
- **AE for media workflows**: code-first multi-model/agentic pipelines for scripting → visuals → subtitles → packaging → publishing, with evaluation and governance as first-class outputs.
- **AE for applied learning**: studio-style teaching that links prototype building to evaluation, documentation, and responsible AI practice.

## What I build

- Multi-agent workflows for annotation, evaluation, and quality assurance (human/LLM hybrid).
- AI-native media pipelines that minimize “legacy tool” dependence and maximize reproducibility.
- Teaching formats that combine **within-team collaboration** with **between-team competition** (project outcome–oriented).
