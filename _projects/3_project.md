*Interdimensional Interview Room / 异次元访谈室* is a video program produced with an AI-native, code-first workflow: multi-model orchestration and tool-using agents replace most “legacy” media tooling, enabling rapid iteration with low production overhead.

Focus:
- End-to-end pipeline design (scripting → visuals → subtitles → packaging → publishing)
- Evaluation-aware production (quality checks, consistency, and governance artifacts)
- Practical templates for teaching (studio projects and capstones)
